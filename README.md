# Pacman Factory

### Project Description
Pacman Factory is an example of Javascript to use a button that generates a pacman with a randomized direction and velocity, which will reverse direction when it comes into contact with the border of the screen. 

### How to Run
Download the files into a single top level directory and open the HTML file in a browser. Press the "start game" button and then "Add Pacman" to generate a pacman. 

### Roadmap of future improvements
Future improvements include changing the color of the pacmen on impact with the border or changing size. Or replacing the pacmen with pacwomen. It's a big world out there.
